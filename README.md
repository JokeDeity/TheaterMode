How to Use

    Version: 
		  If you are using the V1.5 release you just need to download and run, but let me know if sounds don't work 
		  or anything seems broken.  ((This is the version I suggest to use.))
	
          If you are using the V1.0 .exe from the archive in the releases section you just need to extract 
		  everything to one location and then launch the .exe.
    
          If you download the files from the repository you will have to run the python script 
		  (dmod.py) from either CMD Prompt or Powershell:
				CD into the folder
				"python dmod.py"



    Hotkeys: Set them as you would like in the settings window, there's one for setting the veil, one for pausing 
	it,	one to toggle cursorlock, and one to toggle always on top.

    Activate: Hold your Veil hotkey to start selecting areas for the , or press it once to cover the 
	entire screen(s).

    Select: Click and drag to create one or more transparent focus rectangles.

    Deploy: Release your hotkey to lock the selection and fade in the veil.

    Toggle: Use your pause hotkey to pause and resume the effect with the selection you have.

    Configure: Right-click the system tray icon to adjust opacity, colors, timing, veil types and more in the 
	settings window.
